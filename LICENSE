The FFMPEG library is optionally loaded by the audio widget.
The parts FFMPEG the audio widget uses are licenced under LGPL as far as I can tell
(see https://github.com/bgrins/videoconverter.js/blob/master/LICENSE).
However, it is possible that the FFMPEG build I used contains GPL v2+ code,
in which case this code base may be required to be GPL licenced.
So, if the FFMPEG code this project uses contains GPL code,
this project is licenced under the GPL v3, otherwise, it is Apache licenced.
